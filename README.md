This project aims to implement the Deep Dream technique, which consists of generating images through the activation of different layers of a pre-trained neural network. For this, the TensorFlow library is used, which allows working with deep learning models.

The code starts by generating a random image with 256x256 pixels and 3 color channels (red, green, and blue). Then, the pre-trained InceptionV3 model is loaded, its architecture is visualized, and the 'mixed5' layer is selected as the one to activate.

The 'calc_loss' function is responsible for calculating the value of the loss function from the generated image and the model. This function takes as input an image and the model, and returns the value of the loss function. The loss function is calculated as the sum of the means of the activations of the selected layer.

The 'DeepDream' class is responsible for implementing the logic of the Deep Dream algorithm. This class receives the model as input and is responsible for applying the gradient descent optimization algorithm on a given image. This class has a method that receives as input an image, the number of iterations (or steps) to execute, and the size of the step to take in each iteration. The method returns the loss function and the image generated after optimization.

Finally, the Deep Dream algorithm is executed on the generated image, several iterations are carried out and the result obtained after each iteration is shown.
